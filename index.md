Sustainable Development is an approach that can be used by software teams to
ensure a consistently healthy approach to their work over long periods.

Part of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) reads:

> _"Agile processes promote sustainable development._  
> _The sponsors, developers, and users should be able_
> _to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."_

Sustainable Development is a set of [3 simple principles](principles) that
further refines the above. Adopting the Sustainable Development principles helps
teams work healthily, and for longer.

### Why Practice Sustainable Development?

Many software teams work unsustainably. It is easy to find stories of engineers
being overwhelmed working long hours over evenings and weekends, or having
stressful pressure applied to them to deliver on unreasonable timelines.

Too much stress causes engineers to perform worse, be less creative, and
eventually burn out and resign. While this is obviously tough for the engineer,
this is also difficult for their employer as the cost of hiring and training
a replacement is usually high.

Ensuring a stress-free workplace with reasonable expectations for team members
is a worthwhile ethical goal. Adopted widely enough, it will benefit the
whole software engineering industry.

### How Does it Work?

Teams that adopt the [3 principles](principles) start by working to
define together how they believe they can operate sustainably.

* Firstly, Each team will create their own approaches based on their own
culture, challenges, mission, and beliefs. Crucially, their approach to
sustainable development must be defined by all team members, especially
including management.

* Secondly, Once the team has defined their approach, they must strive to follow
it. For example, if a team collectively agrees that they should rarely work past
6pm, it doesn't help if most of the team responds to emails late at night.

* Thirdly, the entire team should strive to improve their own chosen approach
to sustainable development. They can do this through retrospectives and other
kinds of feedback sessions. Again, this should include all the stakeholders
who are affected by the choices made in the team's approach to sustainable
development.

### Getting Started

After familiarizing yourself with the [3 principles](principles) of Sustainable
Development, learn about how other teams put them [into practice](in-practice),
read the [FAQ](faq), and browse the [resources](resources) for further reading
on the importance of work/life balance and other approaches to stress reduction
in the workplace.

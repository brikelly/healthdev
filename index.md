Sustainable Development is an approach that can be used by software teams to
ensure a consistently healthy approach to their work over long periods.

Part of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) reads:

> _"Agile processes promote sustainable development._  
> _The sponsors, developers, and users should be able_
> _to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."_

Sustainable Development is a set of [3 simple principles](principles) that
defines how a software team can operate in a way that encourages good work/life
balance, reduces stress, and improves employee retention.

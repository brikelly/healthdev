**Why aren't the 3 principles more prescriptive? I was expecting them to say
things like "Teams should only work from 9 to 5...".**

A highly prescriptive model would likely never get adopted by any team, since
it would have to match their business needs and existing team culture.

If the principles of Sustainable Development were very precise and dictated
exactly how all teams who follow it should work, it would simply fail to be
adopted.

The 3 principles instead focus on *empowering* team members to work with their
management to collectively agree on how they should operate. They're the experts
on their own team, so they are best positioned to determine their optimal way
of working.

**What's stopping a team saying they follow Sustainable Development, but
their stated practices are to work 18 hours a day?**

Nothing! If a team collectively agrees with their management that very long
hours and weekends will be sustainable and healthy, that's their decision to
make.

The Sustainable Development principles do offer protection against
unhealthy models being proposed:

* A team would have to collectively agree that 18 hour workdays are sustainable,
and not just have management dictate those terms.
* Candidates seeking employment on that team could ask to review their
Sustainable Development practices, and seeing 18-hour days would likely make
those candidates think twice before accepting an offer with them.
* The third principle (of continuous improvement) should quickly highlight the
fact that 18 hour workdays are unsustainable, and lead to improvements being
collectively made to change those stated practices.

**What if all the engineers on my team agree to adopt this, but our managers
do not?**

Sustainable Development is very likely to fail without agreement from
the managers of a team.

Without their buy-in, following the first principle (where the whole team
collectively defines their own practices) would lead to a working model being
set up without management's approval, and that would almost certainly lead to
it causing problems.

The success of Sustainable Development in an organization requires the
agreement and participation of the team's management.

**Isn't this just obvious? Don't all teams do this implicitly?**

Most teams do build tribal awareness of their own work practices, but they
are rarely written down explicitly. When they are written down, they are
sometimes too loosely-specified to be actionable.

**I'm an engineer. How can I convince my manager to adopt this?**

Engineering managers can only benefit from adopting Sustainable Development!

They could easily see:
* Better retention rates
* Higher employee morale
* Improved hiring funnel

Remember, Sustainable Development isn't just for engineers. It's for their
managers too! Everyone gets to participate and decide on how to work at a
healthy pace, and for the long term.

**I'm an engineering manager. How should I roll this out?**

Following Principle 1 (collectively defining your own sustainable work
practices) is the most work, but it's not difficult. If you have never discussed
work practices with them before, meet with your team and ask for their input on
how they'd like to work, and come to the table with how you'd like the team to
operate. Then try to reconcile the two models into something everyone can
all agree on.

Secondly, just make sure you follow your own stated practices, remembering
that as a manager your example carries a lot of weight. So if your practice
says "no working while on vacation" and you reply to some emails
during your time away, your team might think that Sustainable Development
isn't being practiced any more, or that you believe you're exempt.

Lastly, make sure to follow the third principle and continuously improve your
own stated work practices to be more sustainable.

Here are some concrete suggestions on how to put Sustainable Development into
practice at your own workplace.

1. It's not just about working hours. Teams should consider anything that can
affect a team's ability to work sustainability and effectively: interruptions,
physical work environment, meetings, trust, psychological safety, vacation
policies.
1. Run a retrospective when the team has to work late hours or weekends, or
when their own approach to sustainable work wasn't consistently followed due
to work pressures. Take action based on the outcome of the retrospective.
1. Publish your own Sustainable Development practices online.
1. If you're interviewing, ask if the team is practicing Sustainable
Development. If they are, ask to see their practices, whether they are following
them consistently, and how they've evolved over time.
1. If you're hiring, promote the fact that you're practicing Sustainable
Development, share your own practices, and be transparent about how well your
team follows them.

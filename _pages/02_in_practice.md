Here are some concrete suggestions on how to put Sustainable Development into
practice at your own workplace.

1. Run a retrospective when the team has to work late hours or weekends.
1. If you're interviewing, ask if the team is practicing Sustainable
Development. If they are, ask to see their practices, whether they are following
them consistently, and how they've evolved over time.
1. Publish your own Sustainable Development practices online.
1. If you're hiring, promote the fact that you're practicing Sustainable
Development, share your own practices, and be transparent about how well your
team follows them.
